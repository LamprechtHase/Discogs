The idea of this style is to reduce display brightness just enough that Discogs can be used at night without damaging the eyes.
Backgrounds are shades of grey instead of pitch black.
Hyperlinks in orange give this style a warm touch.
Red headings are another eyecatcher underlining the warm glow of this style.
Plays well with night color shift.
Changing colors to personal preference should be easy in case desired.
I try to keep everything as simple as possible. I'm actively using this style and plan to constantly update and bugfix it.
Bug reports are welcome since I'm using only a fraction of Discogs.
